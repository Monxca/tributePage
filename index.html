            <h2 class="heading">Brief Summary Of Stephen Hawking</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="listSpace">Stephen Hawking, in full Stephen William Hawking, English theoretical physicist whose theory of exploding black holes drew upon both relativity theory and quantum mechanics.</li>
                <li class="listSpace">He also worked with space-time singularities.</li>
                <li class="listSpace">In the early 1960s Hawking contracted amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, an incurable degenerative neuromuscular disease. He continued to work despite the disease’s progressively disabling effects.</li>
                <li class="listSpace">In 1971 he suggested the formation, following the big bang, of numerous objects containing as much as one billion tons of mass but occupying only the space of a proton.</li>
                <li class="listSpace">In 1974 Hawking proposed that, in accordance with the predictions of quantum theory, black holes emit subatomic particles until they exhaust their energy and finally explode.</li>
                <li class="listSpace">His work was also important because it showed these properties’ relationship to the laws of classical thermodynamics and quantum mechanics.</li>
                <li class="listSpace">1974 the Royal Society elected him one of its youngest fellows.</li>
